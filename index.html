                As a software engineer at Spühl GmbH, I worked on the acquisition, aggregation and evaluation of data
                from different machine control units. The data was used to optimize processes and increase the
                production efficiency. Thereby, I used different technologies and programming languages such as Java,
                Python, Docker, Azure IoT, database systems (SQL and NoSQL) and web technologies.

                    <p>
                        In
                        this thesis, it is shown that a neural network based on Gated
                        Recurrent Units (GRUs) can be used to predict frames of speech
                        up to one word in length. More precisely, a model is proposed
                        and trained on the TIMIT data-set to predict for a small number
                        of given frames of a Mel-spectrogram the subsequent frames.
                        The predictions are examined in detail and strengths as well as
                        weaknesses of the system are highlighted. Results are presented
                        on how many frames should be used as input and how high the
                        accuracy of the prediction per frame and per phoneme is. As this
                        is one of the first works in this area, especially the lessons learnt
                        are pointed-out and possible improvements for future works are
                        proposed.

                        In my bachelor thesis, the digitalization of the products of the company Spühl GmbH is
                        examined on the basis of different aspects. The existing processes are critically scrutinized in
                        order to minimize the project and product risk and to involve the customer more closely into the
                        development. The developed concept for new processes is validated with the development of a
                        new software.<br>
                        The application enriches the already captured machine data with data from the production
                        process. The application consists of a Java backend (with spring boot), a swagger interface and
                        a React frontend.<br>

                        The Bachelor thesis was graded with the highest grade 6.0
