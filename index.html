                    Welcome to my personal website. I'm a MSc. student at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences.
                    At the same time, I work at the university’s recently founded <a
                        href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/">Centre for Artificial

                    Thereby, I focus on pattern recognition in the field of computer vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in finding new principles to efficiently learn good representation of high dimensional data.
                    Good representations allow systems to perform actions and to do reasoning while beeing robust.
                    Therefore, I am currently working on integrating findings from neuroscience into computer algorithms.

                <p>
                    Besides research, I'm responsible for our computing infrastructure (i.e. several DGX servers) and demonstrators to showcase the capability of AI.
                    I have a background in electrical engineering and computer science and have 5+ years of experience
                    as a software engineer.

Sager <i>et al.</i>, "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Vertebrae Detection and Identification in 3D CT Volumes Using a Domain Sanity Loss", <i>Journal of Imaging</i>. 2022; 8(8):222. <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/8/8/222" target="_blank">doi: 10.3390/jimaging8080222.</a>

                    A variety of medical computer vision applications analyze 2D slices of computed tomography (CT) scans, whereas axial slices from the body trunk region are usually identified based on their relative position to the spine. A limitation of such systems is that either the correct slices must be extracted manually or labels of the vertebrae are required for each CT scan to develop an automated extraction system. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approach for vertebrae detection and identification based on a novel Domain Sanity Loss (DSL) function. With UDA the model’s knowledge learned on a publicly available (source) data set can be transferred to the target domain without using target labels, where the target domain is defined by the specific setup (CT modality, study protocols, applied pre- and processing) at the point of use (e.g., a specific clinic with its specific CT study protocols). With our approach, a model is trained on the source and target data set in parallel. The model optimizes a supervised loss for labeled samples from the source domain and the DSL loss function based on domain-specific “sanity checks” for samples from the unlabeled target domain. Without using labels from the target domain, we are able to identify vertebra centroids with an accuracy of 72.8%. By adding only ten target labels during training the accuracy increases to 89.2%, which is on par with the current state-of-the-art for full supervised learning, while using about 20 times less labels. Thus, our model can be used to extract 2D slices from 3D CT scans on arbitrary data sets fully automatically without requiring an extensive labeling effort, contributing to the clinical adoption of medical imaging by hospitals.

                    When applying deep learning methods in an industrial vision application, they often fall short of the performance shown in a clean and controlled lab environment due to data quality issues. Few would consider the actual labels as a driving factor, yet inaccurate label data can impair model performance significantly. However, being able to mitigate inaccurate or incomplete labels might also be a cost-saver for real-world projects. Here, we survey state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to resolve such missing labels, noisy labels, and partially labeled data in the prospect of an industrial vision application. We systematically present un-, weakly, and semi-supervised approaches from 'A' like anomaly detection to 'Z' like zero-shot classification to resolve these challenges by embracing them.

                <p>
                    Monitoring diverse sensor signals of patients in intensive care can be key to detect potentially
                    fatal emergencies.
                    But in order to perform the monitoring automatically, the monitoring system has to know what is
                    currently happening to the patient:
                    if the patient is for example currently being moved by medical staff, this would explain a sudden
                    peak in the heart rate and would thus not
                    be a sign of an emergency. Therefore, the system is extended with video analysis capabilities and
                    movements of the patient and the medical staff are detected.

                    Body composition analysis can improve patient prognostication and contribute to higher safety,
                    efficiency and quality of the patient journey. This analysis is often neglected due to the high

                    this thesis, it is shown that a neural network based on Gated
                    Recurrent Units (GRUs) can be used to predict frames of speech
                    up to one word in length. More precisely, a model is proposed
                    and trained on the TIMIT data-set to predict for a small number
                    of given frames of a Mel-spectrogram the subsequent frames.
                    The predictions are examined in detail and strengths as well as
                    weaknesses of the system are highlighted. Results are presented
                    on how many frames should be used as input and how high the
                    accuracy of the prediction per frame and per phoneme is. As this
                    is one of the first works in this area, especially the lessons learnt

                <h3>Bachelor Thesis</h3>
                <p>
                    In my bachelor thesis, the digitalization of the products of the company Spühl GmbH is
                    examined on the basis of different aspects. The existing processes are critically scrutinized in
                    order to minimize the project and product risk and to involve the customer more closely into the
                    development. The developed concept for new processes is validated with the development of a
                    new software.<br>
                    The application enriches the already captured machine data with data from the production
                    process. The application consists of a Java backend (with spring boot), a swagger interface and
                    a React frontend.<br>

                    The Bachelor thesis was graded with the highest grade 6.0

                <h3>Hate Speech Detection</h3>
                <p>
                    This is one of my first ML projects in the field of NLP. According to this <a
                        href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification/step-2-5?hl=hi">guide</a>,
                    I trained a sepCNN model on about 150'000 Twitter posts. In the end, the trained model predicted
                    with an accuracy of 96% if a given text is hate speech.

                <p>
                    In this project thesis, I developed a solution for data acquisition together
                    with a fellow student. The application is based on Azure IoT. Different docker containers
                    collect various data, then this data is optimized with Stream-Analytics, sent to the cloud and
                    optionally stored in a database or visualized using PowerBI.
