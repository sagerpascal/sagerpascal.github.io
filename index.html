                <p>
                    After starting my professional career as a hardware engineer, I developed an increasing interest in
                    programming. By studying computer science I got the required skills, which I try to enhance through
                    exciting projects in my free time. Thereby, the most important factor for me is to learn new
                    things. I like to develop a useful application, preferably with programming languages or frameworks
                    that are not yet familiar to me.<br>
                    When programming, I prefer to solve complex problems whose solution is not obvious. Recently, I
                    often find these challenges in the field of machine learning. That's why I started with a Master's
                    degree in Data Science at the Zurich University of Applied Science. At the same time, I can deepen
                    my knowledge as a research assistant in the field machine learning at the Institute of Information
                    Technology.

                        In this bachelor thesis, the digitalization of the products of the company Spühl GmbH is
                        examined on the basis of different aspects. The existing processes are critically scrutinized in
                        order to minimize the project and product risk and to involve the customer more closely into the
                        development. The developed concept for new processes is validated with the development of a
                        prototype. Subsequently, it is evaluated if the adapted processes have a positive effect on the
                        product.
