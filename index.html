                <p>
                    After starting my professional career as a hardware engineer, I developed an increasing interest in
                    programming. By studying computer science I aquired the required skills, which I try to enhance
                    through exciting projects in my free time. Thereby, having fun and Learning new things is the most
                    important factor for me.<br>

                    When programming, I prefer to solve complex problems whose solution is not obvious. Recently, I find
                    these challenges in the field of machine learning. That's why I started with a Master's degree in
                    Data Science at the Zurich University of Applied Science. At the same time, I am deepening my
                    knowledge as a research assistant at the research institute of the university.

                As a software engineer at Spühl GmbH, I worked on the acquisition, aggregation and evaluation of data
                from different machine control units. The data was used to optimize processes and increase the
                production efficiency. Thereby I used different technologies and programming languages like Java,
                Python, Docker, Azure IoT and database systems.

                        In my bachelor thesis, the digitalization of the products of the company Spühl GmbH is
                        examined on the basis of different aspects. The existing processes are critically scrutinized in
                        order to minimize the project and product risk and to involve the customer more closely into the
                        development. The developed concept for new processes is validated with the development of a
                        new software.<br>
                        The application enriches the already captured machine data with data from the production
                        process. The application consists of a Java backend (with spring boot), a swagger interface and
                        a React frontend.<br>

                        The Bachelor thesis was graded with the highest grade 6.0
