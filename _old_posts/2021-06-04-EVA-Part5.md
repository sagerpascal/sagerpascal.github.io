summary: This is the 5th post related to the course "EVA Artificial Intelligence Seminar". In this post, I critically assess my own performance during the AI seminar and examine whether I have been able to achieve my personal goals.

*This blogpost was created as a homework assignment in the [Artificial Intelligence seminar](https://moodle.msengineering.ch/mod/data/view.php?d=62&rid=3128&filter=1). In this seminar we have to write a series of blogposts. In this post, I evaluate my performance during the AI seminar and examine whether I have been able to achieve my personal goals.*

# About the AI Seminar
The AI Seminar is about improving very basic tools of a researcher: Studying, writing and presenting scientific literature. 
As I wrote in [my first blog post](https://sagerpascal.github.io/english/msc/homework/eva-ai-seminar/2021/03/05/EVA-Part1/), I consider this very important skills for any engineer or researcher. 
A good engineer/researcher should not only master the technical aspects but also be able to read and understand scientific literature in order to benefit from findings from others. Additionally, he must be able to communicate his own findings appropriate to third parties such as other researchers, customers or his supervisor. 

This seminar had an effort of 2 credits, which corresponds to 60h according to the Bologna system. If we consider that there exist entire Bachelor's and Master's programmes about communication with 180 credits and 120 credits respectively, this is of course comparatively very little.
Nevertheless, we were able to acquire specific skills in this seminar, from which we will not only benefit when writing our thesis, but throughout our entire professional life.

I really liked this seminar because it does not focus on general communication but on scientific communication. During studies at a university of applied sciences, the scientific communication is unfortunately neglected far too often, although it is an incredibly important tool for anyone working in this field.
I have also made this experience myself. After my bachelor's degree, I started working as a research assistant. Suddenly I had to communicate scientifically without ever having learned it. I tried to teach it myself by reading papers. However, I often had trouble finding the right papers and evaluating whether they were relevant to my use case.
I also wrote papers in a way that felt right, instead of reading up how it should be done.

To say it right away: I still have these problems - but much less. In the AI seminar we were taught different techniques and approaches to overcome the challenges mentioned above. In group discussions, we often highlighted difficulties or discussed typical mistakes. 
These practice-based seminar has thereby improved my communication skills by a lot.

However, as described at the beginning, due to time constraints we could not go into the details of communication as its done in Bachelor's or Master's programmes in this field.
But this seminar gave us more than just a good introduction to this topic and provided us with further reading. As I want to improve my communication skills, I will use this opportunity to study more about scientific communication.

I am also convinced that scientific communication is best learned by applying it. Like most of the participants in this seminar, I still have to write two project theses and a master thesis. By doing so, I will not only be able to apply what I have learned, but I will also be able to improve my scientific communication skills further.

# My Goals
I defined some goals that I would like to accomplish by the end of the seminar in [my first blog post](https://sagerpascal.github.io/english/msc/homework/eva-ai-seminar/2021/03/05/EVA-Part1/). These goals were:
- find papers faster and assess their relevance for a given problem
- read papers more efficient
- get prepared to write papers as well as project- and master-theses

Unfortunately, I have not defined metrics to evaluate if I have achieved these goals (however, I learned in the seminar that one should do to this).

During this seminar, I learned how to search scientific literature and what to look out for. Often, the search engines have a bias towards publications by well-known companies (Google, Facebook, ...) as well as well-known experts (Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, ...). Of course, this is not bad per se, but one should be aware of it. 
So in the seminar I not only learned where to find papers, but also what to look out for.

After finding the literature, it is necessary to assess its relevance. I have learned that it is not mandatory to read the paper section by section, but that it often makes sense to read the abstract and the conclusion first. After that, it can be decided whether the rest of the paper should also be studied. Once a paper has been found relevant, the sections "Previous Work" and "Introduction" often contain references to other relevant papers. Personally, I believe that assessing relevance often requires a good understanding of the topic. Otherwise, the intuition of how to apply the findings of the paper to a specific problem is missing.
Anyway, I learned these basics in the seminar and was able to apply them while working at ZHAWs research institute.

My third goal concerns the writing of papers. The AI seminar contains two major writing assignments besides the blogposts. We received very detailed feedback on each of them, which was very beneficial.
I have summarised the general points from the feedback and try to apply them in my further career. However, I need much more practice to write high quality papers efficiently.

Overall, I think that my expectations have been met and I have achieved my goals. However, I am also aware that I should continue to improve my skills further and I am willing to work on it.

# Assessment of my Performance
In the beginning, I often made the mistake of "thinking in German". This means that I formed a German sentence in my head and then translated it word by word into English (like a Transformer processing token by token ;) ).As a result, my English texts had a very "German structure". I have consciously tried to avoid that and "to think in English‚Äù. My first blogposts not only had this "German sentence structure" but often also contained many translations from a [(great) translation tool](https://www.deepl.com/translator). During the seminar I started to write the blogposts with my own words and without translating them from German to English. I don't know if the quality of my posts is better now - in any case, I can now write much faster and feel much more comfortable. I think this was a good decision from which I can benefit in the long term.

I tried to actively participate during the seminar. I was able to ask many questions and tried to give feedback to my colleagues.
Sometimes, I could have been more active during discussions, but I still believe that I contributed well to the seminar. 

Overall, I am satisfied with my performance. Of course, there is always potential to do things better. But what is most important to me personally is that I was able to learn something from which I can benefit in the long run - and I definitely did that.
