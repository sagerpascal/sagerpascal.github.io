                    Welcome to my homepage! I'm <strong>Pascal Sager</strong>, a PhD candidate at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), a visiting doctoral student at the Institute of Neuroinformatics at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, and an Associated PhD Student at the ETH AI Center. My research is supervised by Prof. Dr. Thilo Stadelmann (Director of CAI) and Prof. Dr. Benjamin Grewe (Head of the Neural Learning and Intelligent Systems Lab at ETH).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My research focuses on advancing AI systems by incorporating general knowledge about the world. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, I explore how deep learning systems can benefit from biologically motivated principles, particularly in how they form and structure internal representations. As part of this work, I investigate world models, trying to make current system more efficient and flexible. My research is supported by a personal fellowship from the Digitalization Initiative Zurich, Switzerland.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Alongside my research, I serve on the board of the Sustainable Impact Program at ZHAW, where I promote the ethical and responsible use of technology. At CAI, I also lead AI demonstrations and workshops, helping to make AI accessible and engaging for a broad range of audiences.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am available for talks and presentations on AI and learning systems. I have experience with a range of formats, including corporate sessions (e.g., Roche), interactive workshops, exhibitions (e.g., Night of Technology, Scientifica), and public talks (e.g., Digital Night Winterthur).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Thank you for visiting my page. I look forward to sharing my research and perspectives with you.
